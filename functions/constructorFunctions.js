    1. The keyword (function)
    2. The function NAME.  For Constructor Functions, the name should be capitalized.
    3. The parameters.  These will be the values of the object once this function is in use.
    4.  The 'this' keyword.   'this' give us the ability to refer back to whatever called, or whatever activates it.  In this case, 'this' refers to 'Person'
    5. This will be a key of the new object we will create.  This is NOT refering to the parameter.
    6. This is refering to the parameter we pass through our constructor function.
    7 & 8: This 'new' keyword is calling our Person function, creating a new person with the values we passing as arguments, and storing that person in a variable.
